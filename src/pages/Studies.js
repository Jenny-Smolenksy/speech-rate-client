                     Speech rate measurement has many impacts in different fields.<br/>

                     <h3>Cerebral palsy</h3>
                     <p> About 50% of children with cerebral palsy (CP) have communication disorders. 
                        The most common cause of which is dysarthria. 
                        Results of this explanatory study suggest that a short block of intensive therapy focusing on stabilizing childrenâ€™s respiratory and phonatory effort and speech rate can increase the intelligibility of their single words and connected speech to familiar and unfamiliar listeners. </p>

                  speech rate while reading and syllable repetition in Parkinsonian

                     <p>Improving intelligibility
                     is often the primary goal of speech therapy in patients
                     with dysarthria. Speech rate has been considered as the
                     most modifiable variable for improving intelligibility of
                     dysarthric speech.
                     Clinically significant improvements in intelligibility were found in half of the participants with different types of dysarthria.
